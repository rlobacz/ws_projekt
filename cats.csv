American Curl,15 - 18 years,5 - 10 pounds,4,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,"A stray longhaired black female cat with funny-shaped ears won over Joe and Grace Ruga in Lakewood, California in 1981. They adopted this cat and named her Shulamith. Six months later, this cat gave birth to kittens with unusually curled ears. Shulamith represents the foundation female for the entire American Curl breed, which originated as a result of spontaneous mutation. Selective breeding of American Curls began in earnest in 1983. After studying 81 litters (383 kittens), British feline geneticist Roy Robinson reported that ear-curling gene is autosomal dominant (a term that means that any cat with even one copy of the gene will display this ear-curling trait). The American Curl was first exhibited at a Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) show in Palm Springs, California in late 1983. The CFA first approved the American Curl for registration in 1986 and granted this breed championship status in 1993.","Despite its sophisticated, elegant look, the American Curl is down-to-earth. This breed has a reputation for being loyal, affectionate and adaptable to new household situations. It is cuddly but never clingy.

This breed defies the popular myth that cats hate water because it will try to join you in the shower. Put the spotlight on this cat. If you don't pay enough attention, your American Curl is likely to strike an adorable pose right in front of the television set. This breed is definitely an early riser and has been known to deliver wakeup calls through nose kisses, head bumping and hair licking of their owners. Capable of learning how to fetch and other games, this breed is not as energetic or active as say, Abyssinians or Siamese.","Despite its sophisticated, elegant look, the American Curl is down-to-earth.

Egyptian Mau,18 - 20 years,6 - 14 pounds,1,4,4,1,1,3,2,4,"Archaeologists have discovered cats in the tombs of ancient Egyptians that look a lot like the Egyptian Mau of today. Regarded as one of the oldest domesticated cat breeds, the Mau may be related to a spotted subspecies of the African Wild Cat. The American lineage of Egyptian Maus can be traced back to the cattery belonging to exile Russian Princess Nathalie Troubetskoy, who came to the United States in 1956. The Cat Fanciers Association first recognized this breed for cat show competition in 1968.","Ranks as one of the most athletic and agile cat breeds. Maus are capable of leaping six feet in the air from a standing position and running up to 30 miles per hour. You need to play with them daily to unleash their pent up energy. Maus are often regarded as being aloof because they take their time in forming friendships with people and other pets. They tend to be even tempered and aware of everything that is going on around them. They are very loyal and devoted to their favorite people and will display their affection in dog-like ways - such as waiting at the door to greet you when you come home and bringing you a toy to start playtime or chirp or chortle at you to get your attention if they notice something happening like a bird on the feeder or a spider crawling on the kitchen floor. They can develop friendships with other family pets, but need to do so on their timetable and terms. They are not readily receptive to interacting with non-resident pets.","Easily mistaken for an Ocicat or even a Bengal, the Egyptian Mau sports natural spots not only on the coat, but the skin, too. The main difference is that Maus are smaller than these two breeds. The Mau displays a lithe, athletic body, wedge-shaped head, almond-shaped gooseberry colored eyes and a coat that comes in silver, bronze and smoke colors. Maus take up to two years before reaching physical maturity.","Easy, minimally shedding coat benefits by being wiped down once a week with a slightly damp washcloth to retain its shine.",Their high-energy nature enables them to burn off calories This breed does not have any special nutritional needs.,"The word, Mau, means ""cat"" or ""sun"" in Egyptian. The Egyptian Mau competes with the Abyssinian for bragging rights as being the most direct descendant of ancient Egyptian cats. The head stripes on this breed resemble a scarab beetle, regarded as Egypt's holy beetle that was often touted as a symbol of the sun."

Attempts to create an all-brown cat proved more challenging than anticipated. Professional breeders had tried since the late 1800s, but did not achieve this feat until possibly in the 1930s in Great Britain. Allegedly, the breed got its start when a Seal Point Siamese was mated with a black shorthaired cat to create the first litter of all-brown kittens. Controversy surrounded this brown cat when the British Siamese Cat Club blocked it from competition until 1952 when a team of breeders mated Siamese with Russian Blues and black domestic shorthairs to officially create the Havana Brown breed. All North American Havana Browns can trace their lineage to a male cat named Roofspringer Mahogany Quinn from the mid-1950s.

A British breeder named Brian Sterling-Webb devoted 10 years to create a longhaired color point cat and earned breed recognition from the Governing Council of Cat Fancy in 1955. Two years later, Marguerita Goforth, a California breeder, successfully petitioned the Cat Fanciers Association to recognize the Himalayan as a new breed. CFA recognized four Himalayan colors - seal point, chocolate point, blue point and lilac point. In 1966, the first Himalayan earned a CFA grand championship title.

RagaMuffin,15 - 18 years,10 - 20 pounds,5,3,3,4,4,4,4,1,"One can trace this breed's ancestry back to Josephine, the Ragdoll original cat from the 1960s.
